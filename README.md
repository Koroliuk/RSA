# RSA
RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is one of the public-key ctyptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission. The RSA asymetric cryptography algorithm is based on the practical complexity of factorization of large numbers, which makes is one of the most popular cryptographic algorithms today.

RSA can encrypt numbers up to the module that is part of the key. Modules with a length of 1024, 2048 and even 4096 bits are used nowdays. This realization of RSA use 64-bit keys, but it is enough for clarity. Encryption and decryption are performed by ***encrypt*** and ***decrypt*** functions in accordance.
